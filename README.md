## Project Description
CarGo is a Spring Boot web application that allows customers to browse, reserve, and pay for rental cars online.

- Customers can register or log in, view vehicles by category (Economy, SUV, Luxury, etc.), and make reservations.
- Reservations are validated against car availability to prevent overlaps.
- A secure Stripe payment system enables credit card payments for confirmed bookings.
- Role-based access with Spring Security ensures data protection:
    - CUSTOMER â†’ browse cars, make reservations, and complete payments
    - ADMIN â†’ manage vehicles, users, and reservations via CRUD operations
- File uploads (e.g. driverâ€™s license images) are supported.
- Styled with Bootstrap 5 for a modern, responsive interface.
- Deployed on Heroku with an integrated MySQL database (AWS RDS).

## Architecture Overview
CarGo follows a Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller (MVC) architecture:

- **Model** â€“ JPA entities (User, Vehicle, Reservation, etc.)
- **View** â€“ Thymeleaf templates styled with Bootstrap
- **Controller** â€“ Spring MVC controllers handling business logic and data flow
- **Service Layer** â€“ Encapsulates reservation validation, Stripe integration, and business rules

---

## Integrations
- **Stripe API** â€“ Handles secure payment processing (PaymentIntent, confirmation, and webhooks).
- **Heroku + RDS** â€“ Cloud-hosted deployment with MySQL backend.

---

## Challenges and Learnings
- Implementing reliable date-overlap detection for car reservations.
- Handling Stripe payment flows with asynchronous webhooks.
- Ensuring secure routes and CSRF protection for sensitive endpoints.
- Designing a visually clean and user-friendly interface.
